# ATM-Machine-Simulation
The Digital ATM is a Java-based web application that simulates real ATM operations. It uses Servlets for business logic and JSP for the user interface. Users can generate a card and PIN, check balance, deposit, withdraw money, and view mini-statements, with all transactions securely validated and stored in a database.
